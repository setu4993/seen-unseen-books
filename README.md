# The SeenÂ and The Unseen - Books

A couple weeks ago, as I was about to start 'The Three Languages of Politics', I was wondering just how many episodes of [The Seen and The Unseen](http://seenunseen.in/) had the book been recommended in. One thing led to another, and I wondered: "Which are all the books that have ever been recommended on the podcast, and in which episodes?" I didn't think there was an easy way to find that, so, I built one.

A few hours and a couple weekends later, here we are.
