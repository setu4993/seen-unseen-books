# The SeenÂ and The Unseen - Books

A couple weeks ago, as I was about to start 'The Three Languages of Politics', I was wondering in how many episodes had the book been recommended on [The Seen and The Unseen](http://seenunseen.in/). One thing led to another, and I tried to answer the question of "Which books have ever been recommended on the podcast, and in which episodes?" I didn't think there wasn't an easy way to find that, so, I built one.

A few hours and a couple weekends later, here we are.
